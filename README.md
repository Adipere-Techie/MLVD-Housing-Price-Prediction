#  Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Visualization

This project explores how machine learning and data visualization can be used to predict house prices and support real estate investment decisions. The analysis is based on the **Ames Housing Dataset**, which contains detailed information on residential properties in Ames, Iowa.

---

##  Project Overview

We trained two machine learning models — **Random Forest Regressor** and **Gradient Boosting Regressor** — to predict house prices based on features like living area size, year built, overall quality, garage area, and neighborhood.

The results of the models were evaluated using standard metrics and visualized through an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to uncover market trends and provide actionable insights.
